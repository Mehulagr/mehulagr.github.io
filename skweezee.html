			<h4>Soft Objects that Sense their Shape Shifting</h4>
			<hr>
			<div class="project_content">
				<h4>Abstract</h4>
					<p>Skweezees are soft objects, filled with conductive padding that can be deformed or squeezed by applying pressure. The electrodes sense the shape shifting of the conductive filling by measuring the changing resistance between every possible pair of electrodes. Moreover, Skweezees can be programmed to recognize specific shape deformations; users can record their own squeeze gestures and these gestures are afterwards distinguished. Problem statement was to use Skweezee system to design a tangible product.</p><br>
					
				<!--
				<h4>Methodology</h4>
					<p>Literature and similar products were studied to identify the various fields were this product would be beneficial. We converged into specific problem areas taking considerations like technological effectiveness, time frame etc. Remote cushion was chosen as context of use for prototyping. A user study was conducted to check the most appropriate gestures for tasks like- starting TV, stopping TV, changing channel, increasing and decreasing volume. The users were given cushion and asked to perform various gestures related to functions of the remote. All participants will first perform the gestures blindfolded or normally. Then they were asked to modify the cushion using crafting material such that it helps them assist in performing gestures. Classification of gestures was done, followed by analysis to find the gestures appropriate for users. Prototype was developed based on the gestures which were defined using user research.</p><br>
				-->
					
				<h4>Study of Exisisting Work</h4>
					<p>Similar products were reviewed and the areas which they targeted (or proposed to target) were listed down. Delving into daily life of users to know the objects they use and problems they face, gave us probable areas where Skweezees can be beneficial. Children, Old-age and people with disorder were also considered as a potential users.<br>
					Also other areas were thought/brainstormed about where soft objects seem useful. Through this exercise we try to diverge into Skweezee’s application domain.</p><br>

				<h4>Figuiring out the Application Area</h4>
					<p>With Children, Old age, Disorder, Wearable, One Handed Interaction, Full Body Interaction, Health and Wellness and others as starting point, mind mapping was done. Mind Mapping Helped answer various questions like- What are the objects that users interact with? What are the similar research done in those fields? How can Skweezee system prove useful in that area?<br><br>
					Probable Areas that were considered were- Gaming Product for Chronic Pain, Re-designing Remote, Wrist Band, Interactive and programmable teddy bear, Interactive Jacket and Smart Sofa. These were narrowed down based on time constraint, technological constraint, etc.</p><br>
					
				<h4>User Study</h4>
					<p>Remote has been there for long time and hasn’t changed much. The “technological and hard” remote doesn’t fit the comfortable environment (sofa, cushion and soft lights) of living room. Also, it often gets lost in some corner of the room. What if we convert the cushion of your sofa into your remote?<br><br>
					Taking this as staring point it was decided to conduct a user to study what will be the gestures that would be most appropriate for users? How should the cushion look like? What gestures would be appropriate for users when they are not looking at the cushion?<br><br>
					<img src="image/skweezee/s2.jpg" width="100%"></img>
					“Wizard of OZ” user study was conducted with 20 users. The users were given cushion and asked to perform various gestures related to functions of remote. All participants will either performing the gestures without-blindfold or with-blindfold (Task 1) and then participate in the creation activity (Task 2). The functions that users were asked to accomplish were Start TV, Stop TV, Volume Up, Volume Down, Next Channel, Previous Channel, Menu Open, Menu Exit and Mute.

				<h4>Analysis</h4>
					<img src="image/skweezee/s4.jpg" width="100%"></img>
					<p>Analysis of gestures was conducted to identify the gestures most appropriate for users. Videos of each user was broken down to keep only the 9 gestures of each users for 20 users. Followed by open coding the gestures from the video. Then these open codes were axial coded to find the relationship among location of gesture, direction of gesture, type of gesture and function (task). <br><br>
					<img src="image/skweezee/s5.jpg" width="100%"></img>
					Some additional considerations for finalizing gestures were that gestures should be easy to remember, gestures should be designed such that unintended gesture detection is minimal and that it can be performed without looking at cushion.</p><br>
					
				<h4>Conclusion of User Study and Prototyping</h4>
					<p>Final Gestures that were considered for current prototype were-<br>
					Start TV- Squeeze all of it<br>
					Stop TV- Squeeze all of it<br>
					Next Channel-Squeeze forward side (Middle right or Top Right)<br>
					Previous Channel- Squeeze backward side (Middle Left or Top left)<br>
					Volume Down- Pull Middle-top away from the center<br>
					Volume Up- Push Middle-top towards the center<br><br>

					Conductive Cotton, Conductive Thread and Conductive Tape were used to make the prototype. And Processing was used to code the prototype.</p><br>
